It may be a good idea to look at old issues, both closed and open.

Some recurring problems are:

 * The user did not perform the merge before doing the analysis.
 * No violations were reported because:
   * The user tested the plugin on a PR that did not introduce any new violations.
   * The user had both `createSingleFileComments` and `createCommentWithAllSingleFileComments` set to `false`

When reporting a bug, please **try** to provide as much information as possible.

 * Plugin version used.
 * Jenkins version used.
 * Your configuration.
   * Pipeline script or screenshot.
 * Expected result and actual result.
 * Any information from the logs:
   * Jenkins log: http://jenkins-server/log/
   * Build log.
